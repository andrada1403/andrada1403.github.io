According to recent studies, I believe that algorithms will take over analytics. People from the IT industry will see the rise of AI pretty quickly. I personally got inspired by a YouTube video uploaded by one of my favorite channels with it's main subject being jobs that will thrive in the future. Majority of future jobs will be impacted by automation. Someone needs to program the AI in terms of what to look for, this can make an impact on various industries. I decided I want to look forward and work on my own software skills in order to keep up with the upcoming world we'll ve living in.
